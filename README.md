# LambdaTest

I wanted to learn to use Func<T, TResult> in methods, so I can learn how to use lambda and delegates in my own project, since i had no clue how to use it. Other than that, I wanted to learn how to build a dynamic expression from text     
 
The code is very very messy, but it was a small project i made over a day, to learn how to use it. Maybe in the future I will refactor it into more classes, make interfaces and refactor the methods so I can use it as a reference

The search algorithm is made from logic, there's no mathmathic patterns, maybe in a later iteration, I'll also introduce this - it depends on time.       
   
Features:       
Search for a person with multiply conditions     
Supports operators: >, < and |      
ex. Birthday > 23-11-1993 &  Name = Patrick      
ex. Age > 19 | Birthday < 01-01-1989
